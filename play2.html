    <h6 class="LORD_WINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="stage_directions">[_R.C._]</p>  <p class="speech">Mrs. Erlynne is coming here, and if you in
any way annoy or wound her, you will bring shame and sorrow on us both.
Remember that!  Ah, Margaret! only trust me!  A wife should trust her
husband!</p>

<h6 class="LADY_WINDERMERE">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="stage_directions">[_C._]</p>  <p class="speech">London is full of women who trust their
husbands.  One can always recognise them.  They look so thoroughly
unhappy.  I am not going to be one of them.  <p class="stage_directions">[_Moves up_.]</p>  Lord
Darlington, will you give me back my fan, please?  Thanks. . . . A useful
thing a fan, isn’t it? . . . I want a friend to-night, Lord Darlington: I
didn’t know I would want one so soon.</p>

<h6 class="LORD_DARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p class="speech">Lady Windermere!  I knew the time would come some day;
but why to-night?</p>

<h6 class="LORD_WINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="speech">I _will_ tell her.  I must.  It would be terrible if
there were any scene.  Margaret . . .</p>

<h6 class="PARKER">PARKER.</h6>  <p class="speech">Mrs. Erlynne!</p>

<p class="stage_directions">[LORD WINDERMERE _starts_.  MRS. ERLYNNE _enters_, _very beautifully
dressed and very dignified_.  LADY WINDERMERE _clutches at her fan_,
_then lets it drop on the door_.  _She bows coldly to_ MRS. ERLYNNE, _who
bows to her sweetly in turn_, _and sails into the room_.]</p>

<h6 class="LORD_DARLINGTON">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  <p class="speech">You have dropped your fan, Lady Windermere.</p>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Picks it
up and hands it to her_.]</p>

<h6 class="MRS._ERLYNNE">MRS. ERLYNNE.</h6>  <p class="stage_directions">[_C._]</p>  <p class="speech">How do you do, again, Lord Windermere?  How
charming your sweet wife looks!  Quite a picture!</p>

<h6 class="LORD_WINDERMERE">LORD WINDERMERE.</h6>  <p class="stage_directions">[_In a low voice_.]</p>  <p class="speech">It was terribly rash of you to
come!</p>
